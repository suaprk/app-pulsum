The app PULSUM is a plant and mental care application.

The app we're developing provides basic plant recognition, watering reminders, and journaling features, but redesigns these functions to focus on users' mental and emotional wellbeing. We expect plant care to serve as a tool for self-reflection and mental health management beyond just being a hobby.

This is a project for 2025 mobile computing course in CAU Art&Technology.
